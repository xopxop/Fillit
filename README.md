<h1>Fillit Project</h1>
<strong>Status: Finished</strong><br/>
<p>ðŸŒ± Fillit will take a file as parameter, which contains a list of Tetriminos, and arrange them in order to create the smallest square possible. Obviously, the goal is to find the smallest square in the minimal amount of time, despite an exponentially growing number of possibilities each time a piece is added.
A Tetriminos is a 4-blocks geometric figure you probably already heard of, thanks to the popular game Tetris.<br>
<h2>Usage</h2>

```bash
$ make
$ ./fillit [file]
```

<h2>Make test file</h2>
